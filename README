Introduction
============

cl-charms provides CFFI bindings to libcurses, for most Common Lisp
implementations.

It is intended to succeed cl-ncurses, which used the less portable
UFFI instead of CFFI for foreign bindings.

Indeed, cl-charms includes portions of code from cl-ncurses, and is
largely a direct translation of the latter's UFFI definitions to CFFI.

Currently, it is probably feature-equivalent to cl-ncurses and
compatible with client code.  In the future, cl-charms may break
compatibility with cl-ncurses and may provide additional
functionality.

cl-charms is developed by Abhishek Reddy <abhishek@abhishek.geek.nz>,
beginning in October 2010.  It is released under an MIT-style license.
See the file COPYING for details.

Portability
===========

cl-charms has been tried with the following:

*   CLISP 2.49 on Debian GNU/Linux (testing) x86-64
*   ECL 10.7.x Git HEAD on Debian GNU/Linux (testing) x86-64
*   SBCL 1.0.42 on Debian GNU/Linux (testing) x86-64
*   CCL 1.4-r13119 on Debian GNU/Linux (testing) x86-64

cl-charms has been tried with libncurses on Debian GNU/Linux
(testing) only.  It may coincidentally be compatible with other curses
libraries and operating systems.

cl-charms ought to function on other implementations of Common Lisp
and libcurses on various distributions of GNU/Linux.  See the section
on Bugs and Contributing below for how to help test and realize this.


Installation
============

*   Extract or copy the cl-charms/ directory somewhere

*   Ensure that the file cl-charms/cl-charms.asd is in a path known to
    your installation of ASDF (see asdf:*central-registry*)

*   Evaluate something like this in your Lisp implementation:

    > (asdf:load-system :cl-charms)

Bugs and Contributing
=====================

Contributions in the form of bug reports, patches, requests or
suggestions are welcome.  Use the issue tracker for the project in
gitorious.org for submissions.

Major areas of work to be done:

*   Lots of missing functions inherited from cl-ncurses to be defined.
*   Untried on various GNU/Linux distros and architectures.
*   Untried with non-libncurses libraries.
*   Test cases and sample applications.
*   Only provides curses functions, lacks menus, panels or CDK.
